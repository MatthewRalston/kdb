Thank you to the authors of kPAL and Jellyfish for the early inspiration. And thank you to others for the encouragement along the way, who shall remain nameless. I wanted this library to be a good strategy for assessing these k-mer profiles, in a way that is both cost aware of the analytical tasks at play, capable of storing the exact profiles in sync with the current assemblies, and then updating the kmer databases only when needed to generate enough spectral signature information.

The intention is that more developers would want to add functionality to the codebase or even just utilize things downstream, but to build out directly with numpy and scipy/scikit as needed to suggest the basic infrastructure for the ML problems and modeling approaches that could be applied to such datasets. This project has begun under GPL v3.0 and hopefully could gain some interest.

Also thank you to patelvivek (github/viviensio) for the Github ribbon on this page.


Thanks to my former mentors BC, MR, IN, CR, and my newer bosses PJ and KL.
Thanks of course to Liftco Gymdustries for the facelift.
Thanks to the Pap lab and the DOE for the first dataset that I continue to use.
Thank you to Ryan for the food and stuff.
Thanks to Blahah for tolerating someone snooping and imitating his Ruby style.
Thanks to Erin for getting my feet wet in this new field.
Thanks to Rachel for the good memories and friendship.

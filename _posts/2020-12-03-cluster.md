Now you would like to cluster your count matrix, perhaps after reducing dimensionality of the dataset. tSNE is a recommended choice for using the count matrix to differentiate between strains or species. PCA is equally useful in understanding the differences between species and reducing the dimensionality to something reasonable is an important first step before clustering.


```bash
# You may supply any arbitrary count tsv to cluster, and it will run that directly.
>./bin/kdb cluster -k 3 example.tsv

# Alternatively, you may pipe the result from kdb matrix directly to kdb cluster.
# The matrix command will not produce PCA reduced dimension matrix unless the -n parameter
# is identified from the elbow graph it will produce as a side effect.
>./bin/kdb matrix PCA -n 3 test/data/*.$K.kdb | ./bin/kdb cluster -k 3

# Alternatively, t-SNE may be used to project the data into 2 dimensions for visualization.
>./bin/kdb matrix tSNE -n 2 test/data/*.$K.kdb | ./bin/kdb cluster -k 3
```

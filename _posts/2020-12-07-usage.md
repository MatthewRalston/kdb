## How to view --help

Use '-h' to view detailed usage information about the subcommands

```bash
>./bin/kdb -h
usage: kdb [-h] {profile,header,view,matrix,rarefy,cluster,distance,index} ...

positional arguments:
  {profile,header,view,matrix,rarefy,cluster,distance,index}
                        Use --help with sub-commands
    profile             Parse data into the database from one or more sequence
                        files
    header              Print the YAML header of the .kdb file and exit
    view                View the contents of the .kdb file
    matrix              Generate a reduced-dimensionality matrix of the n *
                        4^k (sample x k-mer) data matrix.
    rarefy              Generate rarefaction information using
                        ecopy.diversity.rarefy for the supplied .kdb files
    cluster             Cluster the files according to their k-mer profile
    distance            Calculate various distance metrics between profiles
    index               Create a index file that can be held in memory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```


## How to generate profiles from included test datasets

A typical workflow first requires the generation of k-mer profiles. The following command will generate multiple profiles at $K-mer resolution simultaneously.

```bash
parallel './bin/kdb profile -k $K {} {.}.$K.kdb' ::: $(/bin/ls test/data/*.fasta.gz)
```
